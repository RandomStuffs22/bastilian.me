    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Dicovering new music, listening to the latest album of my favorite artists, seeing them live. All that is a big part of my life, therefore i decided to show you my favorite albums of this past year. Of course there are much more albums I listened to, but these are the ones I still listen to.</p>

<h2>Mumford &amp; Sons - Babel</h2>

<p><img src="/images/posts/mands_babel.jpeg" alt="" /></p>

<p>What i loved about their previous album was there ability to build up tension within there songs and cause a amazing explosion of emotions. With this album the keep it this way. "I Will Wait" is the favorite of most on this record, it also is mine. I did not yet have the chance to see them live, but i imagine it an amazing concert.</p>

<h2>Band of Horses - Mirage Rock</h2>

<p><img src="/images/posts/BOH.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>I listened to "Knock Knock" when they revealed the video for it, before the album release. I was stunned. It was much more rocky then I expected. The whole album is more decorated with a lot more drums and and guitar action. Rumors say that even Jimmy Page likes it.</p>

<h2>Japandroids - Celebration Rock</h2>

<p><img src="/images/posts/06137_prc-238estore.jpeg" alt="" /></p>

<p>And a celebration of rock it is. "The House That Heaven Built", what a song. When I hear it, I need to bang my head. It is impossible not to. After enjoying it for weeks I had to see them live. I went out of there completely soaked. Not onlye due to the fact that the little venue was packed.</p>

<h2>Best Coast - The Only Place</h2>

<p><img src="/images/posts/The-Only-Place-cover1.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>This album ruled my summer. Go out into the sun and turn on "The Only Place". And dance. This is what it does to you. Here in vienna we don't have the ocean, we don't have the babes and we also don't have the waves, but this makes you feel we do. It will probably continue to be a record I will listen to when I want to escape the city for a moment.</p>

<h2>Paul Banks - Banks</h2>

<p><img src="/images/posts/bankspackshot.jpeg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Oh, Paul. His solo project "Julian Plenti" was already a good move. Not saying Interpol isn't good, but somehow his solo projects seem to bring out the best of him and suit his voice even better. Even though it is sometimes rocking it keeps you in a melancholic mood.</p>
